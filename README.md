# Cs-255-Portfolio
During the DriverPass project, my main goal was to create a user-friendly platform for driver training and testing services for our client, DriverPass. One of my noteworthy strengths during the project was creating an effective UML class diagram, which provided a clear structural overview of the system. However, if I had the opportunity to revise a part of the project, I would focus on validating the assumptions made in the "Assumptions" section to ensure that we had accurate information. One of the most crucial aspects of the project was interpreting the user's needs to ensure that the final system aligned with the client's goals and the user's expectations. My approach to software design involved thorough analysis, planning, and iterative development, which emphasized clear documentation, usability testing, and consistent feedback from users and stakeholders.
